# HEA cGAN Demonstrator Package and Notebooks
A demo of a conditional Generative Adversarial Network for High Entropy Alloy design developed by 
[**ULTERA** (ultera.org)](https://ultera.org) team at Penn State  under the 
[**DOE ARPA-E ULTIMATE program**](https://arpa-e.energy.gov/?q=arpa-e-programs/ultimate) that
aims to develop a new generation of materials for turbine blades in gas turbines and related
applications.
